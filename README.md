# Excel-VBA
An example code of how I created my VBA to transform my data. 
I used the data to forecast the price of the international price of coffee using R programming.

I cannot share the raw data since it requires permission from the International Coffee Organization(ICO). I provided two screenshots to demonstrate the before and after the data cleaning.
